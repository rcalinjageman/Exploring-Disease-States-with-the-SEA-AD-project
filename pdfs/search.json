    "text": "The goals of this pre-lab are to:\n\nGain an understanding of the SEA-AD project.\nBuild confidence in accessing the SEA-AD interface and exploring this vast dataset.\n\n\nWhat is the SEA-AD project?\nFirst, let’s get to know a bit more about the SEA-AD project, which was reported by (Gabitto et al. 2024) in this Nature Neuroscience paper.\nWe’re not going to read the whole paper, but let’s take a look at part of Figure 1 (Panel A), where they outline the project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nIt might look complicated, but here’s the basic idea: collect brain tissue samples, sequence RNA from individual neurons to measure gene expression, use that transcriptional data to sort cells into different types (we’ll cover this in more detail later), and then analyze the data for gene expression differences related to Alzheimer’s disease\nNow let’s take a look at the heroic donors who were studied for the SEA-AD project. This part of Figure 1 (Panel B) gives information about the donors based on levels of symptoms for AD: high, intermediate, low, or had no AD diagnosis (the healthy controls).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding:\nQ1: In the boxplot of ages by group above, the line in the middle of each box represents the median age. Using that median as the “typical” value, what is the typical age of donors with high levels of Alzheimer’s?\n\nAbout 70 years old\nAbout 80 years old\nAbout 90 years old\nAbout 100 years old\n\nQ2: What is the typical age of the donors with no AD?\n\nAbout 70 years old\nAbout 80 years old\nAbout 90 years old\nAbout 100 years old\n\nQ3: Why is it important that the researchers found healthy donors of about the same age as those with high levels of Alzheimer’s disease symptoms?\n\nBecause if the ages were very different, it wouldn’t be possible to know if differences in gene expression were due to Alzheimer’s or to normal aging.\nBecause if the ages were very different, there could be generational differences that would make it difficult to know if the gene changes observed were really due to Alzheimer’s.\nBecause if the ages were very different, there could be other age-related factors influencing the results.\nAll of these!\n\nQ4: Overall, were there more female or more male donors in this study?\n\nMore female donors\nMore male donors\nThe exact same\n\nQ5: Female donors are only slightly more represented than male donors in the “No AD” group. Is the same true for the high AD group?\n\nYes, it’s the same proportion.\nNo, female donors are under-represented in the high AD group.\nNo, female donors are even more over-represented in the high AD group.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding and Representing Gene Expression Data\nThe SEA-AD project measured gene expression from individual cells in the CNS of AD and healthy donors. Because RNA is transcribed from DNA this is often called transcriptomic data – data that measures all the transcripts a single cell currently expresses.  Additionally, in order to classify different cell types based on gene expression, we use a representation called a UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection).  To represent levels of gene expression of specific genes to compare across different cell types we can also use a heatmap. \nLet’s hear from Meuler & Casimo (2024) on their explanation of how single cell RNA sequencing works and how it is represented as UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and heatmaps.\nThe remainder of the text and figures in this section are adapted from their work:\n“Transcriptomic data is a type of data that allows scientists to investigate which genes a cell is transcribing/expressing and in what quantities. If a cell, and more specifically, that cell’s nucleus, contains a specific RNA transcript, this indicates that the cell is expressing the specific gene associated with that RNA. By (1) isolating nuclei, (2) sequencing the mRNA transcripts found within the nuclei, and (3) counting those transcripts, we can tell which genes the cell is expressing and how much these cells are expressing these genes. Repeating this process for thousands of cells from a sample of brain tissue allows researchers to find similarities and dissimilarities between cells on the basis of their gene expression. These patterns of similarity and dissimilarity are then used to classify certain cells as specific “types.” The graphic below explains in detail how scientists gather and interpret transcriptomic data.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\nCheck Your Understanding:\n\n\nQ6: The SEA-AD project measured ____ in individual cells from the brains of healthy and AD donors.\n\nDNA\nRNA\nProtein\n\n\n\nAll of the above\n\nQ7: For each cell, sequencing enabled the SEA-AD researchers to quantify:\n\nThe expression of one gene for each cell\nThe expression of many genes for each cell\nThe expression of one protein for each cell\nThe expression of many proteins for each cell\n\nQ8: For the UMAP plots shown in Figure 1 of Gabitto 2024, each dot represents a single:\n\nPatient\nCell\nRNA\nBrain region\n\n\n\nUsing the Cell×Gene Explorer for the SEA-AD dataset\nLet’s roll up our sleeves and figure out how to explore the SEA-AD data.  It’s a complex data set, but we can do it!\n\nAccess the SEA-AD data through the Cell x Gene explorer: https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/1ca90a2d-2943-483d-b678-b809bf464c30 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\n\nYou’ll find many options to explore. The first item on the list is the complete SEA-AD dataset for the middle temporal gyrus (“Whole Taxonomy - MTG: Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Atlas (SEA-AD)”). Next, you can access the full dataset for the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (“Whole Taxonomy - DLPFC: Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Atlas (SEA-AD)”).\nFollowing these are breakdowns of the data by specific cell types (for example, just the Lamp5 cells, just the Pax6 cells, etc.). These subsets help make the project’s vast data more manageable and easier to focus on.\nFor our first exploration, let’s start with the whole dataset for the middle temporal gyrus. Click Explore next to the “Whole Taxonomy - MTG: Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Atlas (SEA-AD)” option to begin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8\n\n\n\n\nGet to know the interface. You should now see the Cell × Gene explorer displaying the SEA-AD data. Your screen will look like this: filters and mappings on the left, a UMAP visualization of all individual cells in the center, and the gene explorer panel on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the zoom tool -  In the large middle panel, you’ll see the UMAP — a visualization representing every cell sequenced in this database, totaling 1,378,211 cells! Right now, it might just look like a big black blur. Let’s zoom in to see more detail! Click the Zoom tool, then use your mouse to zoom in and out of the UMAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11\n\n\n\nAs you zoom in, you’ll begin to see individual small dots – each dot represents a single cell – it could be a neuron, or nonneural brain cell type such as a microglia, or an astrocyte… whatever was sequenced\nNow Zoom back out to where you can see the whole UMAP.\n\nColor cells by a category with the raindrop tool: To better understand the UMAP, we can color-code the cells based on their characteristics using the raindrop tool. Start by clicking the raindrop tool and selecting disease. This will color the cells so that those from donors with Alzheimer’s disease appear purple, while cells from healthy donors appear green. Pretty cool, right?\n\nTry coloring by other characteristics. For example, can you color the cells by the sex of the donor (males/females)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand the UMAP: This looks cool, but why are the cells shown as these lumpy smudges? The position of each cell is determined by how similar it is to other cells based on gene expression. In other words, cells placed close together have similar gene expression profiles across their entire transcriptomes, while cells farther apart are less similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14\n\n\n\nPlacing cells on a UMAP like this reveals clusters of transcriptionally similar cells, which is how researchers in this project defined different cell types.\nTo explore this yourself, use the raindrop tool to color by cell_type. Then, expand the cell_type heading (click on the arrow &gt;) to see a detailed view — your screen should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15\n\n\n\nWhen you hover your mouse over different cell types in the list, they’ll be highlighted on the map. To label the different populations, click the list icon located to the right of the zoom tool.\nYou’ll notice the purple “islands” represent L2/3-6 intratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic neurons. The bright green islands at the bottom left are Lamp5 GABAergic cortical interneurons. Notice how the glutamate islands and GABA islands are quite far apart — excitatory and inhibitory neurons have distinctly different gene expression profiles!\n\nUnderstand the group-level summaries.  Once you’ve color-coded your cells, the Cell×Gene explorer has a neat feature — it shows how that color coding breaks down across other groups. It might sound a bit tricky, but stick with me!\n\nCollapse the cell_type list and then expand the disease list. You’ll see a stacked bar graph showing the distribution of cells in the dementia group versus the normal group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the breakdown of different cell types — like the purple glutamatergic neurons and the green GABAergic neurons — within the dementia group and the normal group. While the dementia group has 536,608 cells and the normal group has 841,403 cells, the stacked bars let you compare the proportions of each cell type in both groups.\nAlthough we can’t draw definitive conclusions from this summary alone, generally, what does this suggest?\n(1) That there are radical differences in the cell types found in dementia (AD) donors compared to normal donors.\nOR\n(2) That both groups appear to have roughly the same breakdown of cell types.\n\n\nIf you picked the second option, great job! The cell type distributions do look fairly similar, which suggests Alzheimer’s may not cause dramatic changes in cell types within the middle temporal lobe. Interesting, right?\n\nLearn how to filter.  Instead of color-coding, you can also filter the data to focus on specific cells. For example, you might want to explore gene expression changes only in female donors. Filtering is simple — just expand the category you want and select the cells to keep.\n\nFiltering lets you narrow your focus to specific groups of interest, making it easier to detect patterns or differences that might be hidden when looking at the entire dataset. This targeted approach can reveal insights specific to certain populations, like female donors, that could be important for understanding disease mechanisms. Here’s an example showing only the cells from female donors:\n\n\nLet’s start working with some genes! If you’ve been filtering, be sure to reset and select all cells again. Now, we’re ready to dive into gene expression.\n\nIn the Quick Gene Search box (right side of screen), type XIST and hit enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17\n\n\n\nAnd add it to your gene list:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18\n\n\n\n\nColor-code by Gene Expression.  The XIST gene has our old friend the water-drop tool.  Click it and you can color code the cells in our UMAP by their level of XIST expression.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19\n\n\n\n\nYour UMAP will now look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20\n\n\n\nWhat does this show us? The green cells have very low expression of XIST – while they have two copies of the gene in their DNA, they aren’t actively transcribing much XIST mRNA. In contrast, the blue cells show higher levels of XIST mRNA expression.\n\nLook at the overall expression histogram.  Click the &lt;&gt; (double arrow) button to expand the information about XIST.  You’ll see a histogram showing the distribution of expression levels for XIST among all the cells in the current database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21\n\n\n\nA histogram shows how common different scores are. In this case, the Y-axis represents the number of cells, and the X-axis shows gene expression levels. Each colored bar tells you how many cells have that specific level of expression for the gene.\nThink of it like a popularity chart at a party – the taller the bar, the more people (or cells) have that particular “popularity score” (gene expression level).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22\n\n\n\nThis histogram looks unusual! Let’s try to make sense of it.\nFirst, notice the huge bar right at zero. What does that tell you?\n\nThat there are zero cells that fail to express XIST.\nOR\nThat there are a large number of cells that don’t express XIST at all.\n\nIf you chose the second option, great job! That big bar shows there’s a large group of cells with almost no XIST expression.\nNow, take a look at the other cluster of bars forming a nice “bell curve”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23\n\n\n\nWhat does this other set of bars tell us?\n\nThat there is a group of cells expressing XIST, but at varying levels—some a little, some more.\nOR\nThat XIST must encode a protein shaped like a bell.\n\nThis histogram reveals two distinct patterns of XIST expression: a large group of cells that don’t express it at all, and another group that does, with varying amounts.\nQ9. Why do you think there’s this difference? What distinguishes these two groups of cells?\n\nFind out more about a gene.Click the (i) icon to find out more about XIST.  You’ll get a brief summary as well as a link to NCBI’s information about this gene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24\n\n\n\nQ10. From this description you might hypothesize that:\nA. XIST is a gene only expressed in females\nB. XIST is a gene only expressed in males\nC. XIST is a gene of unknown function, so maybe it is the cause of AD\nWhat this tells us is that XIST is a gene responsible for silencing one of the two X chromosomes in genetic females. Ah-ha! This means XIST is expressed in female cells but not in male cells – which helps explain our histogram, where some cells show no XIST mRNA and others show quite a bit.\nLet’s dig in and see if that’s really the case!\n\nExplore Differential Expression by Comparing Expression Maps Across Groups\n\nTo learn more about XIST expression, we’ll compare its levels in cells from female donors versus male donors. The Cell×Gene explorer isn’t the simplest tool for this, but don’t worry — we will work through it together.\nFirst, roll down the selector for sex on the filer/mapping panel on the left:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25\n\n\n\nRight away, the Cell×Gene explorer is showing you the XIST expression broken down by sex. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26\n\n\n\nQ11. What can you tell from this?\nA. That cells from female donors are the ones expressing XIST, corresponding to the “bell curve” in the histogram of all cells.\nB. That cells from male donors do not express XIST, matching the large peak at zero in the histogram.\nC. That XIST expression is highly sex-dependent: cells from male donors show little to no expression, while female donor cells express XIST at varying levels.\nD. All of the above.\n\n\nYou can see that female cells display that nice bell-shaped curve of expression—most produce XIST mRNA, with some expressing a bit more or less. In contrast, male cells only show the tall bar at zero, indicating almost no XIST expression.\nThis is a qualitative difference in gene expression – if you picked a single cell and checked its XIST level, you’d have a pretty good idea whether it came from a biological female or male donor.\nWouldn’t it be great if we could find such clear-cut gene expression differences related to Alzheimer’s disease? Let’s find out as we continue the lab!\n\nMake an Image Demonstrating Differential Expression\n\nTo document our findings, we’re going to create a figure that visualizes the difference in XIST expression between cells from male and female donors.\nHere’s the plan:\n\nFilter the data to show female-only cells (the UMAP should take on a blueish hue indicating moderate XIST expression).\n\n\nAfter filtering, hover your mouse over female in the categories list to ensure it’s selected and not highlighting other groups.\n\n\nThis view shows XIST mRNA expression in cells from female donors.\n\n\nYou can capture this image by taking a screenshot—or better yet, use the SNAPSHOT tool within the explorer to save a high-quality image. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will likely save to your Downloads folder or wherever you have set this on your computer/device\nNote that the file names that are saved with generic names: CELLxGENE_umap_emb.png\nBe sure to rename the saved files so you can identify which group is which!\n\n\n\nNow, switch the filter to show male-only cells (the UMAP should turn bright green, indicating low XIST expression!). Again, hover your mouse over male in the category list to ensure no other groups are highlighted. Then, take a snapshot of this view.\nNext, bring your two images together – one for females and one for males – and label them clearly. You can use PowerPoint, Google Slides, or any other tool you prefer.\nAdd a scale bar to your figure: Since the Cell×Gene explorer’s snapshot doesn’t include a scale bar (which isn’t ideal for scientific figures), be sure to also take a screenshot of the scale separately and include it in your combined image.\n\nYour overall image should end up looking like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 28\n\n\n\nQ.12 Submit your final figure\nQ.13 What can you conclude from this (your figure)?\n\nThat there is a qualitative difference in XIST mRNA in cells from the brains of males and females – cells from females make XIST mRNA (to varying extents), male cells largely do not (without much variability).\nThat the differential expression of XIST seems consistent across all the cell types measured in the Middle Temporal Gyrus – it is the same pattern in the glutamate clusters, the GABA cluster, etc. etc.\nAll of the above\n\nNice work! You’ve gotten hands-on experience using the Cell×Gene explorer to dive into the SEA-AD database. Below are a few challenges to test your skills in navigating and interpreting this rich dataset.\n\n\nTry On Your Own\nNow that you have a good handle on the tool, explore the expression of ZNF536. Examine ZNF536 expression across different cell types by expanding the cell_type category and inspecting the histogram breakdowns. Try checking and unchecking various cell types.\nThink about the following questions as you are checking/unchecking various cell types:\n\nAre there some cell types that express ZNF536 strongly?\nAre there others with little or no expression?\nCan you identify any patterns that explain which cell types express this gene?\n\nQ.15: Create a figure comparing expression between two cell types: one with high ZNF536 expression and one with low or no expression. Combine your images into a single, well-labeled slide and submit the figure.\nQ.16: Describe what you can conclude from this figure in a few sentences.\nYou’ve completed the pre-lab – great job!

    "text": "You’ve learned about the SEA-AD database, the basics of transcriptomic (gene expression) data, and how to navigate the Cell×Gene explorer. Now, it’s time to apply that knowledge to investigate molecular changes linked to Alzheimer’s disease.\nOur research question is: What gene expression changes are associated with Alzheimer’s disease in the microglia of the middle temporal gyrus?\nThat’s a pretty focused question—so where did it come from? Here’s the background:\n\nMicroglia have been strongly implicated in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (Keren-Shaul et al. 2017)\nThe middle temporal gyrus (MTG) is a brain region key to memory processing and among the first areas to show AD-related dysfunction (Papeo, Agostini, and Lingnau 2019; Chen et al. 2022).\nThe SEA-AD team’s own analysis (Gabitto et al. 2024) found that microglia exhibit some of the most significant gene expression changes associated with AD. This gives us a chance to explore one of their major findings firsthand.\nBy focusing only on microglia, we’ll load a smaller subset of the SEA-AD database – important because the site can be unstable or slow when handling the full dataset.\n\n\nMake Predictions\nBefore we begin, make some predictions about what we might find.\nQ1. The human genome contains roughly 20,000 genes. How many of these do you think might be differentially regulated – that is, showing meaningful changes in expression – in cells affected by Alzheimer’s disease?\n\nOne or two genes\nTens to hundreds genes\nThousands of genes\nNearly all the genes\n\nQ2: Think about the complexity of Alzheimer’s disease and the number of cellular pathways it might impact. Would you expect just a handful of genes to be involved, or a much broader shift in gene expression?\nQ3. When considering the impact of Alzheimer’s disease on gene expression, how would you describe the changes you expect to see?\n\nQualitative differences – clear, distinct changes like the “on/off” pattern we saw with XIST expression.\nMore subtle changes – shifts in the level of expression rather than outright presence or absence, meaning the differences are a matter of degree rather than kind.\n\nQ4: Reflect on whether disease-related gene expression changes are likely to be dramatic and categorical, or more nuanced and gradual.\n\n\nStart a Lab Notebook\nDuring this lab we’re going to ask you to explore a complex dataset, and as you explore we’ll ask you to take screen shots and make figures.  \nTo keep a record of your work, start a single document where you can make figures (a Google Slide, a PowerPoint).  When prompted to make figures, add each figure into this document (1 figure per page).  Be sure to take notes or add captions to your figures so you know which figure is which.  You can then submit a single file with all your work at the end of the lab.\n\n\nGetting started\nWe’re going to load the SEA-AD data again, but this time we’ll focus exclusively on the microglia from the Middle Temporal Gyrus (MTG).\nInstead of selecting the top item on the list, scroll down near the bottom and find “Microglia-PVM-MTG: Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Atlas (SEA-AD)”. Click Explore on that option.\nhttps://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/1ca90a2d-2943-483d-b678-b809bf464c30 \nMake sure you select the microglia from the MTG – not the last dataset on the list, which is for the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nYou should now be in the basic SEA-AD explorer, but zoomed in to show only the microglia from the Middle Temporal Gyrus (MTG). Your UMAP will look much simpler, displaying just the microglia cluster from the larger SEA-AD dataset. Your screen will probably look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nQ5: How many individual cells are in this dataset?\n\n0 cells\n40,000 cells\nImpossible to tell\n\nQ6: Think back to the pre-lab.  How many individual donors are in this study?\n\nJust 1, all of these cells are from one human\nAbout 80 donors; each had many cells analyzed\nAbout 40,000 - each donor had just 1 cell analyzed\n\n\n\nExplore 1 Gene: APOE\nLet’s start by looking for a difference in gene expression in a gene already known to be involved in Alzheimer’s Disease: APOE.\n\nEnter APOE in the Quick Gene Search Textbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the water-drop tool to color code the cells by APOE expression. Then, expand the APOE gene entry to view its overall expression histogram. Take a moment to interpret what this visualization tells you about APOE expression in microglia. What patterns or levels of expression do you notice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, investigate whether APOE expression differs in microglia from Alzheimer’s donors compared to healthy donors. Expand the disease category to reveal histograms for each group. Do the histograms look noticeably different?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the check and uncheck buttons to toggle APOE expression visualization for each group individually. Each time you switch groups, be sure to move your mouse pointer back to the UMAP to avoid unintended highlighting of other cells.\n\nQ7: Based on what you see, do the expression patterns appear different between the two groups? Do these histograms seem very different to you?\nQ8: Create a figure comparing the two UMAPs of normal versus AD donors. The figure should look something like what you see below. This will be Figure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\n\nQ9: Do the APOE gene expression UMAPs look very different between microglia from Alzheimer’s donors and healthy donors?\n\nYeah, microglia from AD donors have way more APOE expression.\nYeah, microglia from AD donors have way less APOE expression.\nUhhhh… I really don’t see that much of a difference!\n\nIf you said you don’t see a huge difference, you’re right! While it would be great to download the raw data and run formal statistical tests, this difference doesn’t pass the “ocular test” – meaning it’s not an obvious change you can easily spot just by looking.\n\n\nTest *all* the genes\nWe could keep exploring genes one by one to find those differentially expressed in microglia from AD donors, but with over 20,000 genes in the human genome, that would take ages! There has to be a better way.\nLet’s leverage statistics and computing power to compare gene expression across every gene – one at a time – and identify those with the most statistically reliable differences.\nTo do this, we first need to define two groups in the Cell×Gene explorer: (1) microglia from healthy donors and (2) microglia from donors with Alzheimer’s disease. Once these groups are set, the explorer will handle the heavy computational work of comparing all genes between them.\nLet’s get started!\n\nDefine the set of microglia from normal donors.\n\nIn the disease roll down, uncheck the dementia box and check the normal box so that only microglia from the normal donors are selected.  This should provide 20,124 cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8\n\n\n\nNow, click the Population 1 button (the left “0 cells” button) – this tells the Cell×Gene explorer that this set of cells is the first set that you want to use to compare gene expression.  You’ll see that it tells you that you’ve selected 20,124 cells for this group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10\n\n\n\n\nDefine the set of microglia from the AD donors\n\nIn the disease roll down, you’ll now check the dementia box (that’s the donors with Alzheimer’s) and uncheck the normal box.  You’ll now have 19,876 microglia selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11\n\n\n\nNow click the Population 2 button (be careful not to re-click the Population 1 button).  This should lock in the 19,876 microglia from the Alzheimer’s donors for comparison, and it will make the comparison button turn blue. You can now ask the Cell×Gene explorer to compare gene expression across these two sets of microglia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12\n\n\n\n\nConduct the differential gene expression analysis:\n\nClick the blue Gene Expression Comparison button. The Cell×Gene explorer will process the data, which might take a moment. \nBe aware – sometimes the tool crashes here, so you may need to restart if that happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13\n\n\n\nIf all goes well, you’ll see two gene lists appear on the right side:\nPop 1 high: Since Population 1 is the cells from healthy donors, this list shows genes with higher expression in normal microglia compared to Alzheimer’s microglia.\nPop 2 high: This list contains genes with higher expression in microglia from Alzheimer’s disease donors.\n\nRename our output to make it easier to understand\n\nFor the Pop 1 high list, click the three-dot menu (…) and select “Edit gene set name and description.” In the popup, rename it to “Lower in Alzheimer’s Microglia” \nRemember, this list contains genes that are higher in microglia from healthy donors – but it’s often easier to think of them as being lower in Alzheimer’s microglia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15\n\n\n\nNow, rename the Pop 2 high list. Click the three-dot menu (…) for that list, select “Edit gene set name and description,” and in the popup, rename it to “Higher in Alzheimer’s Microglia” \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17\n\n\n\nYou should now have something like this on your screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18\n\n\n\nWhat is happening when you push that button? Let’s talk about Stats!\nThe Cell×Gene tool uses Welch’s t-test to identify differentially expressed genes between groups of cells. A Welch’s t-test is a statistical test used to compare the means of two independent groups, particularly when the variances of the groups are unequal. It’s an alternative to the student’s t-test (which you may have heard of), which assumes equal variances. Welch’s t-test provides a more reliable comparison when the assumption is violated.\nWe call this extensive data-profiling a screen – it means we can rapidly check for lots of possibilities to “screen” for interesting genes.  This is a great way to discover new and unexpected things.  It’s also an “unbiased” technique because we test *every* gene, not just the ones we already think might be important.  The drawback, though, is that when we screen, we radically increase our risk of over-fitting – finding patterns that might have been true in this sample but which might not really generalize to all Alzheimer’s patients.  In the full SEA-AD project, the authors took steps to avoid this issue (like checking other data sets and with other methods)\nThus, while a differential gene analysis is a great tool, it’s important to know that this method is useful for preliminary investigations and identifying potential markers. It’s recommended to follow up with more robust methods for formal analysis and most especially to test for the same patterns in independent samples to see if they hold up. While the Welch’s t-test is relatively fast and efficient, it may not be as accurate as other, more computationally intensive statistical tests when dealing with single-cell RNA sequencing data (e.g. Ritchie et al., 2015).\n\n\nExplore the Most Up-Regulated Gene, MT-ND3\nLet’s start with the genes up-regulated in microglia from Alzheimer’s donors:\n\nExpand the “Higher in Alzheimer’s Microglia” list\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first gene listed is MT-ND3.  Use the eye-drop tool to color-code the UMAP for MT-ND3 expression.  Also, expand this gene to see its overall expression histogram.\nExplore the expression profile for MT-ND3.  Look at its overall expression histogram.  Think about it: What is this histogram telling you? Do all cells express this gene?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare expression between microglia from normal and AD donors:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoll down the disease filter.  Compare the by-group histograms.  Think about it: Do they seem that different?\nIsolate down to AD (dementia) or normal microglia, screen shot each, and line them up to compare. \n\nQ.10 Be sure to label your images so you know which image comes from which group as you will be turning this in. This will be part of Figure 2.  Your figure should end up looking something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22\n\n\n\nThink about it!\n\nCan you see a clear difference?  Is it dramatic/qualitative or more a matter of degree/quantitative?  Are all AD microglia “abnormal” (different in expression compared to control) or only some?\nWhat does this gene do?  Use the (i) information button to find out more about it. Note: information is not always available for all genes. If no info is listed, look it up here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ or here https://www.genecards.org/\nWhat, exactly, do mitochondria do?\n\nQ11: Write, in your own words, about the difference in expression you are seeing for MT-ND3 based on your created Figure 1.  Would you call this a dramatic change in expression or a subtle change in expression?  Does it seem like most microglia have higher expression in AD or just some?\n\n\nExplore More of the Up-Regulated Genes\nKeep exploring the up-regulated list.  Go on to the 2nd and 3rd most up-regulated (MT-ATP6) and create another figure comparing gene expression differences between normal and AD.\nQ12: Be sure to label your images so you know which image comes from which group as you will be turning this in. This will be the 2nd part of Figure 2 comparing the top two up-regulated genes (MT-ND3 and MT-ATP6)  \nNow, look at the remaining genes on the list. Think about it: Do you notice some commonality in the functions of these genes? What happens to the degree of difference as you work through the list?  Do the differences get more noticeable or less?  Why?  How far down the list before you don’t really feel confident about a difference? \nQ13: Based on your inspection of the list, write a short overall summary in your own words.  Try to express yourself clearly and succinctly (briefly) and without jargon. Your paragraph should help another reader understand:\n\nWhat is the association between AD and gene expression in MTG microglia?\nAre there widespread differences or are they more subtle?\nAre there consistencies in the types of genes related to AD?\n\nQ14: So we will have it for later, write down the top 10 up-regulated genes.  This would work best in a spreadsheet (Excel or Google Sheets).  Be sure to label what your list is.  \nNote: The gene names are sometimes cut off in the Cell×Gene explorer, but if you hover over the name you’ll get the whole thing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the Most Down-Regulated Genes\nNow explore the down-regulated genes:\n\nBrowse through the list\nMake specific gene expression comparison figures (well labelled) for the top two down-regulated genes\nWork down the list to where you no longer feel very confident about the differences, though you don’t have to make figures past the first two genes\n\nQ15: Be sure to label your images so you know which image comes from which group as you will be turning this in. This will be the Figure 3 comparing the top two down-regulated genes\nQ16: Write up a short paragraph summarizing your exploration of the down-regulated genes\nQ17: So we’ll have it for later, also write down the names of the top 10 down-regulated genes.  Write this down as an additional list in the spreadsheet where you wrote down the top 10 up-regulated genes.\n\n\nYour Lab Hand-In So Far\nYou should now have:\n\nFigure 1: A figure comparing APOE expression in the microglia from normal and AD donors (Q8)\nFigure 2: A multipanel figure comparing the top two up-regulated genes (MT-ND3 and MT-ATP6) between normal and AD donors (Q10, Q12)\nA short paragraph summarizing your analysis of the up-regulated genes (Q11, Q13)\nA multipanel figure comparing the top two down-regulated genes (LINC02712 and 3X3CR1) between normal and AD donors (Q15)\nA short paragraph summarizing your analysis of the down-regulated genes (Q16)\nA spreadsheet with 2 labelled lists: the top 10 most up-regulated genes and the top 10 most down-regulated genes. (Q14, Q17)\n\n\n\nThinking Critically About Confounds\nThis is a correlational study – donors were not assigned to have AD (thank goodness!).  But that means we have to be especially worried about confounds – other ways in which these participants/cells might differ beyond AD status.  \nFor example, in the control group, there are 5 female and 4 male donors (55% female).  But in the AD group there are 46 female  and 29 male donors (61% female).  That means that the AD group is not really the same as the control group – females are over-represented.  And that means that what we think is an AD difference might actually just be a sex difference.  Uh oh!  \nWe can check this worry – we can look at if our top genes that differ by AD seem to differ by sex as well.\nExamine if expression of MT-ND3 differs in the microglia of control males and females:\n\nIn the disease drop down, check normal only\nColor code by MT-ND3\nThen in the sex drop-down, check males only and then females only, again screen shotting each group on their own and making a figure for side-by-side comparison.\n\nQ18: Within these normal donors, does it look like females express more MT-ND3 in their microglia? Could this be a confound? Does this complicate our interpretation that MT-ND3 is increased in AD?  How?\nBy the way: The SEA-AD researchers were aware of this issue, and in the paper they published they took additional steps to try to control for the imbalance of genders – science is hard!)\n\n\nWrapping up: Some things to think about\n\nWe saw that the comparison of Alzheimer’s Disease and normal cells was confounded by sex (the AD group had a lot higher proportion of females than the control group). Think about it: How do you think the original researchers of the SEA-AD project dealt with this issue?\nThe SEA-AD project sequenced over 1.2 million cells.  But these came from only 84 individual donors.  What, really, is the sample size?  Normally when we have millions of data points we can feel pretty confident about results generalizing, but should we be more cautious here?  Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChen, Shuo, Yuzhou Chang, Liangping Li, Diana Acosta, Yang Li, Qi Guo, Cankun Wang, et al. 2022. “Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics Reveals Genes Associated with the Vulnerability of Middle Temporal Gyrus in Alzheimer’s Disease.” Acta Neuropathologica Communications 10 (1): 188. https://doi.org/10.1186/s40478-022-01494-6.\n\n\nGabitto, Mariano I., Kyle J.

    "text": "If you enjoyed this lab, you might be excited to know that Cell×Gene Explorer and the SEA-AD dataset are powerful, open-source tools. They are not limited to the questions we worked through here! You can use them to investigate your own hypotheses, just like researchers do.\nBelow is a suggested structure you could use if you wanted to design an independent exploration:\n1. The Research Question\nClearly state what you are curious about.\nExample: “I wanted to know the genes that differ most based on post-mortem interval (the time between death and harvesting of the brain samples).”\n2. Approach (Conceptual, not technical)\nBriefly describe how you designed your comparison groups and what analysis you ran—focus on the idea, not the button-clicks.\nExample: “I defined two populations of microglia: those from donors with short post-mortem intervals and those with long post-mortem intervals. I then compared gene expression between these groups, focusing on the number and types of differentially expressed genes.”\n3. Figures\nInclude one or two clear, labeled figures to support your findings.\nExample: A figure showing expression of the top up-regulated gene and one showing the top down-regulated gene between the two groups.\n4. Conclusion\nSummarize what you learned in a short paragraph.\nExample: “Post-mortem interval strongly influenced microglial expression of genes related to stress responses, suggesting that this factor should be carefully controlled for in Alzheimer’s research.”\nExample Research Questions You Could Explore\n\nGeneralizability (to other brain regions): Do the AD-associated genes we saw in MTG microglia also show up in DLPFC microglia? (Compare AD vs. normal in the DLPFC dataset and see if your top genes overlap with the MTG results.)\nAPOE4 risk allele: APOE4 is a genetic allele associated with a high risk for Alzheimer’s disease. In MTG microglia, what genes differ most between APOE4 carriers and non-carriers? (Define groups by APOE4 status and analyze expression changes.)\nSex differences: Are the AD-associated gene lists similar in male vs. female donors? (Repeat the AD vs. normal analysis separately in each sex and compare.)\nSociodemographic influences: In normal donors, are there genes associated with years of education? (Select “normal” only, then compare low vs. high education groups.)\n\nThese questions are just examples. You are encouraged to come up with your own if something in the dataset sparks your curiosity!",

    "text": "In many cases, neuroscientists have been able to fully-characterize disease states.  For example, we now know that some forms of dementia are actually Neurosyphilis, a disease caused by a CNS infection of the bacteria Treponema pallidum.  Having this understanding of the etiology (underlying cause) allows us to accurately identify a cause for a disease and to develop therapies for treatments.\nUnfortunately, many mental illnesses and neurological diseases remain mysterious – we can observe the symptoms but still don’t have a full understanding of the etiology.  This currently includes disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer’s disease.  That is, while we can clearly see the impacts of these disorders, we can’t yet fully define what these diseases are.\nOne-way scientists are trying to define diseases is by identifying their “molecular signature” – perhaps we can understand Alzheimer’s if we can define what changes, at the molecular level, happen within individual cell types of the CNS as Alzheimer’s disease progresses.  One level of molecular change that has become relatively easy to characterize is transcription – we now have technologies that can measure the expression level of thousands of genes in individual cells.  By assembling large libraries of cell expression levels in healthy and affected donors, we hope to finally be able to define what Alzheimer’s disease is.\nThis is tricky, though.  First, in humans we do not experimentally manipulate Alzheimer’s disease (we do not randomly assign some humans to have the disease), so our studies are correlational, and thus often plagued by confounds that can create alternative explanations.  Second, processing tissue from human donors is difficult – gene expression continues to change in the nervous system after a patient dies, and so there are complex technical and ethical issues to deal with to minimize the impact of mortality on measures of gene expression.  Another difficulty is that transcription is what we can easily measure – but Alzheimer’s disease might not be a problem of gene expression. It could ultimately be a change in post-transcriptional processing, protein conformation due to misfolding or post translational modification (i.e. phosphorylation), etc.  That is, just because we can measure transcription does not mean it will be informative for defining Alzheimer’s.\nIn this lab we are going to explore an incredible undertaking to understand Alzheimer’s that measures gene expression in single cells of human donors.  This project is called the Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD for short).  The project was completed by a large consortium of researchers that includes the Allen Institute for Brain Science, University of Washington BioRepository and Integrated Neuropathology (BRaIN) laboratory and Precision Neuropathology Core, UW Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and the Adult Changes in Thought Study as reported in Nature Neuroscience (Gabitto et al. 2024).\nThe SEA-AD project has generated many terabytes of data measuring gene expression of over 2 million individual neurons in human donors.  All of the data for this project is available online, including a beautiful online atlas that lets anyone explore the dataset and ask their own research questions.\nIn this lab, you are going to learn how to explore the SEA-AD dataset, how to interpret complex gene expression data, and how to find and interpret gene expression differences correlated with Alzheimer’s disease state.\nLooking at gene expression across all cells in the CNS would be too overwhelming for this lab - just take a look at the paper by Gabitto et al., 2024 to get a sense of how overwhelming.\nInstead, we are going to focus on microglia.  Microglia are the brain’s resident immune cells, and are increasingly recognized for their significant role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis, both as contributors to neuroinflammation and potential therapeutic targets. While initially considered a consequence of AD pathology, recent research suggests that microglial reactivity can be an early, upstream event in the disease process (Mrdjen et al. 2025; Thapa et al. 2025).\nDataSet: Microglia-PVM - MTG: Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Atlas (SEA-AD) and Microglia-PVM- DLPFC\nBelow are direct links to the open datasets we’ll be working with in this lab.
